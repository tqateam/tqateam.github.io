				<p>Technology has evolved through the years. In the current era social media has a lot of benefits for the people. Social media is considered as a medium of communication. Social media is not only limited to communication, it is also where we can see the latest trends and daily news, movie trailers and many more. Social media in the current era plays an important role to everyone.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Combining social media and business</h2>
				<p>Combining social media and business is one great thing. First of all most of the people around the world uses social media. Due to that, it is a great idea to have a business in social media. When you advertise in social media people will easily see your advertisement because people can see it faster. More people are in social media than in television so therefore if you advertise in social media it is easier for them to find. Second, people does not have to the mall anymore. For example when they order a phone online they will just wait for the package to arrive and they did not waste money for the gas or for the fair. Having business in social media is far more convenient for the customers around the world.</p>
				<br/>
					In conclusion, social media is for business. It benefits both the business man and the customers. Also there are a lot of benefits for both sides.</p>
